            <h2>Human Dignity</h2>
            <p>This is the belief that every person is created in the image of God and has inherent worth and value. In the Bible, we see this in Genesis 1:27, "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." In the world today, respecting human dignity means treating everyone with respect, regardless of their background, beliefs, or status. Teenagers can follow this by standing up against bullying, advocating for the rights of marginalized groups, and practicing empathy and kindness in their interactions with others.

            <h2>Preferential Option for the Poor</h2>
            <p>Solidarity calls us to recognize that we are all part of one human family and to stand in unity with those who are suffering or marginalized. In the Bible, Jesus teaches about solidarity in Matthew 25:40, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." In the world today, solidarity means supporting efforts to address poverty, injustice, and inequality, both locally and globally. Teenagers can follow this by volunteering in their communities, participating in advocacy campaigns, and building relationships with people from different backgrounds.</p>

        <section id="justice">
            <h2>Social Justice</h2>
            <p>Social justice is the pursuit of a fair and equitable society where all individuals have access to basic human rights and opportunities. In the Bible, we see the call for social justice in Micah 6:8, "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." In the world today, social justice involves advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and fairness, such as fighting against discrimination, supporting affordable housing, and working towards criminal justice reform. Teenagers can follow this by educating themselves about social issues, speaking out against injustice, and getting involved in grassroots movements for change.

            <h2>Stewardship of the Earth</h2>
            <p>This teaches us to be stewards of the Earth and to protect the environment for future generations. In the Bible, God entrusts humans with the care of creation in Genesis 2:15, "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." In the world today, care for creation involves practicing sustainability, reducing our carbon footprint, and advocating for policies that protect the environment. Teenagers can follow this by adopting eco-friendly habits, such as recycling, conserving energy and water, and supporting organizations that work to preserve natural habitats.

            <h2> Why is This Important?</h2>
            <p>These teachings help to build the reign of God by promoting a society where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, where justice and equality prevail, and where the Earth is cherished and preserved for future generations. By following these teachings, individuals contribute to creating a world that reflects God's love, compassion, and concern for all creation.</p>
